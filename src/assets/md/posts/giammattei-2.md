# giammattei.co, Part Deux

#### 08/29/2020

Welcome to the new and improved giammattei.co! While it may look and feel much the same as your last visit (if you were one of the 10 people to visit the site in its first year of existence), under the hood, everything is different.

I made a very deliberate choice when building this site out originally, which was to do it old-school. No fancy frameworks, no abstract magic, no templates. The structure, content and styles of the entire site were hand-coded, by me, line by line.

Just like the websites of old, my project directory had a collection of HTML files, each corresponding to a page on the site, a global CSS file, and a collection of image assets. I used JavaScript for one purpose: showing and hiding the hamburger menu in mobile view.

And it worked! I had created a modern-looking, fully functional site, and I knew every inch of it and exactly how it worked. While I was spared the process of using FTP to deploy my site to a server, in most other ways I was doing web development the way that we all(outside of JavaScript apps hosted on the site) did 10+ years ago.

Along the way, I discovered The Pain Points.

### The Slog

Here's the thing about doing things the old way: there's no abstraction. The biggest lesson of modern programming is DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself.

fix mobile headings!
