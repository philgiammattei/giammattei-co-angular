# A Recipe for Asiago Bread

###### Apropos of nothing, here is a recipe for asiago bread.

### Bruce's note: "I just made it with all whole wheat flour and it was great. I did add one tablespoon of vital wheat gluten to help it hold off the rise. With 50% white bread flour you don't need the extra gluten."

###### Prep: 25 min

###### Rise: 3 hr

###### Bake: 35 min

###### 1 large loaf, 24 slices

When sliced, this large, flour-dusted loaf reveals cheese-lined pockets. Any full-flavored, firm, aged cheese works well. It's a perfect bread for for a country-style dinner as well as toasted for breakfast.

### Ingredients

3 1/2 to 3 3/4 cups bread flour
1 teaspoon sugar
1 package regular or quick active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)
1 1/4 cups very warm water (120째 to 130째)
2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil
2 teaspoons dried rosemary or thyme leaves, if desired
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup diced Asiago, Swiss or other firm cheese
1/4 cup diced Asiago, Swiss or other firm cheese

### Directions

1. Mix 1 1/2 cups of the flour, the sugar and yeast in a large bowl. Add warm water. Beat with wire whisk or electric mixer on low speed 1 minute, scraping bowl frequently. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let stand about 1 hour or until bubbly.

2. Stir in oil, rosemary and salt. Stir in enough remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until a soft, smooth dough forms. Let stand 15 minutes.

3. Place dough on lightly floured surface. Knead 5 to 10 minutes or until dough is smooth and springy. Knead in 1 cup cheese. Place dough in lage bowl greased with shortening, turning dough to grease all sides. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in warm place 45-60 minutes or until double. Dough is ready if indentation remains when touched.

4. Lightly grease uninsulated cookie sheet with shortening. Place dough on lightly floured surface. Gently shape into football-shaped loaf, about 12 inches long, by stretching sides of dough downward to make a smooth top. Place loaf with smooth side up on cookie sheet. Coat loaf generously with flour. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise in warm place 45-60 minutes or until almost double.

5. Place square pan, 8 x 8 x 2 or 9 x 9 x 2 inches, on bottom rack of oven; add hot water to pan until about 1/2 inch from the top. Heat oven to 450째.

6. Spray loaf with cool water; sprinkle with flour. Carefully cut 1/2-inch-deep slash lengthwise down center of loaf with sharp serrated knife. Sprinkle 1/4 cup cheese into slash.

7. Bake 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 400째. Bake 20 to 25 minutes longer or until loaf is deep golden and sounds hollow when tapped. Remove from cookie sheet to wire rack; cool.
