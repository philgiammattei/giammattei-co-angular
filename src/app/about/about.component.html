<h1>STRENGTHS</h1>
<p>
  I am a skilled <em>communicator</em>, both written and verbal. I understand
  the importance of storytelling and presentation when persuading or informing.
  I am capable of expressing complex thoughts in simple terms, which I have used
  in teaching and mentoring roles to great effect.
</p>
<p>
  I am a skilled <em>learner</em>, capable of quickly and efficiently absorbing
  information and processes, discerning when it is necessary to have a robust
  theoretical framework and when it is more expedient to learn by steps. I
  document my learning process such that my notes can be useful for future
  learners.
</p>

<p>
  I am a good <em>team member</em>, who is aware of the capabilities and
  bandwidth of my teammates and plans my own work for maximum utility. I strive
  to have consistent output that can be relied upon confidently.

<h1>EXPERIENCE</h1>
<p>
  I currently work at PNC as an agile full stack developer, specializing in
  Angular, Spring REST, and a micro frontend architecture based on web
  components.
</p>

<p>
  In the fall of 2019 I attended a 14-week coding boot camp at
  <a href="https://www.techelevator.com/">Tech Elevator</a>, where I developed a
  strong foundation in full-stack programming.
</p>
<p>
  I was previously employed at
  <a href="https://kerfcase.com">KerfCase LLC</a>. Kerf is a design firm,
  specialty manufacturer, and e-commerce company that designs, makes and sells
  fine wood goods. Our flagship product is an
  <a href="https://kerfcase.com/products/iphone-xs-wood-case"
    >all-wood phone case.</a
  >
</p>

<p>
  Prior to Kerf, I have worked at Google, Oracle, and Apple, in a variety of
  roles. One of my mottos is "Versatility over Virtuosity"; in a world that
  favors hyperspecialization, having a working knowledge of many domains can be
  very valuable. I am equally at ease communicating technical requirements to
  engineers as I am discussing business priorities with executives and
  brainstorming with creatives.

<h1>HOBBIES</h1>
<p>
  I'm a <em>musician</em>! I play a lot of instruments and enjoy a variety of
  styles, but primarily I play bass and sing for Pittsburgh rock band
  <a href="http://www.badcuster.com">Bad Custer</a>. I had fun making the band's
  website, as well as an iOS app that's mostly done. In addition, I'm looking
  forward to learning how to process sound programatically so I can explore
  musical composition using computers.
</p>

<p>
  I do most of the <em>cooking</em> in our household, and I'm always on the
  lookout for new recipes, especially if it's Indian food, can be made in an
  Instant Pot, or both!
